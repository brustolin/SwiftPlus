# Number+

The Number+ extension provides additional functions to deal with number.

## Usage

### Increment and Decrement (`++` and `--`)

You missed it and we know! And now we got it back!

You can use it as prefix or postfix.

```swift
var myNumber = 0
print(myNumber++) // prints 0 and increment myNumber to 1
print(myNumber--) // prints 1 and decrement myNumber to 0
print(++myNumber) // Increment myNumber to 1 and print it
print(--myNumber) // Decrement myNumber to 0 and print it
```
